Satoru Gojo (Japanese: 五条 悟, Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga and anime series Jujutsu Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu, who suffers a curse of Rika teaches him at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In main series of Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a curse of Sukuna, helping him become stronger while protecting other characters in the series.

He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura in the original Japanese series. From serious scenes to comical gag scenes, Gojo has different facial expressions, but since Nakamura played without restrictions on the swing range, he reiterated at the recording site that he enjoyed gags. The actor did not find a change in Gojo's characterization, finding his mentoring of Yuta similar to the other protagonists from the main Jujutsu Kaisen series. He enjoyed the multiple recording sessions he had, as well as the many school-like relationships. He was impressed by Megumi Ogata's work as Yuta for providing him with a large range of emotions.[13] Mariya Ise voiced the younger Gojo in a flashback from the anime.[2] For the anime's second season Nakamura claims he suffered struggles in properly portraying Gojo due to the two story arcs depicting the same character with different quirks and personality as a result of his age; while people do not change their voices too much over a decade, Nakamura aimed to make Gojo different in the two story arcs from season 2. The voice actor was impressed by the animation studio Mappa which allowed his character to have more facial expressions which resulted in more direction from his superiors.[14]
